    <h3> Background </h3>
    <p> I've had kind of a stressful few weeks, so I wanted to make a game that made me laugh. A friend and I were talking about shows we used to watch as kids, and the Suite Life of Zack and Cody was one of our mutual favorites. Given that the Sprouse twins are proud alums of NYU, I thought it would be fun to do an homage to one of them. I already had this awful pun going, so I ended doing another one for the "hammer." For the record, I did think about using MC Hammer, but his legendary career did not include a stint with Disney to fit the theme. Armie Hammer, according to Google, voiced one of the cars in Cars 3, so that's close enough for me. </p>
    <h3> Design Choices </h3>
    <p> I followed Professor Kapp's base pseudocode to build the logic of the game:
      <ul>
        <li> Create a Mole class that keeps track of x position, y position, and some other variables </li>
        <li> Make sure it can display itself </li>
        <li> Give it the ability to keep track of its "on" or "off" state </li>
        <li> Double check that the state flipping isn't crazy </li>
        <li> Give the object hit detection abilities and keep track of each hit with a score </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
